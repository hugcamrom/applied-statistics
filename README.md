# [**Applied Statistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics#Applied_statistics,_theoretical_statistics_and_mathematical_statistics)

<!--Study of the practical use of statistical methods to collect, analyse, interpret, and present data in real-world contexts.-->

This repository contains my official submission for the **Applied Statistics** assessment.  
It is structured, documented, and reproducible — providing a clear demonstration of statistical understanding and computational implementation.

All finalised solutions and explanations are contained within the main notebook:  
**[`problems.ipynb`](./problems.ipynb)**  

No rough work or exploratory notebooks are included here; all drafts are kept locally.

## Overview & Purpose

The [**Applied Statistics**](https://atu.ie) module enables students to demonstrate their ability to:

1. **Describe** the stochastic nature of real-world measurements.  
2. **Source documentation** to programmatically perform a statistical test.  
3. **Select** the appropriate statistical test to investigate a claim.  
4. **Perform** a statistical test on a dataset and interpret the results.

This repository serves as a single, self-contained record of work aligned with these learning outcomes.

## Codespaces Environment — *Improved Telegram*

This repository is hosted and developed in [**GitHub Codespaces**](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/quickstart), under the workspace named **“improved telegram”**.

By default, a Codespace development environment runs on a **virtual machine (VM)** based on [**Ubuntu Linux**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu#:~:text=Ubuntu%20can%20be%20installed%20directly,for%20platforms%20such%20as%20OpenStack.) and includes many popular tools and languages.  
This setup ensures a consistent, cloud-based environment regardless of your local operating system.

**Key features:**

- Runs entirely in a **Linux (Ubuntu)** environment.  
- Compatible with **Python, Jupyter, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and command-line utilities** preinstalled.  
- You can extend or customise the base image with additional libraries or tools.  
- Windows and macOS are *not* supported as remote container OS options — all Codespaces execute within Linux.  
- Ideal for running notebooks, simulations, and data visualisations directly in the browser.

This approach ensures maximum reproducibility, consistency, and ease of collaboration.

Guidance & Structure

All work is presented in a single Jupyter Notebook: problems.ipynb.
Each problem section includes:

A short plan/approach (Markdown).

Code cells with clear structure and comments.

Outputs and plots with readable labels.

A brief interpretation and discussion of results.

Headings are consistent and sequential:

**# Applied Statistics** (title) → **## Problem 1**, **## Problem 2**, etc.
