# [**Applied Statistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics#Applied_statistics,_theoretical_statistics_and_mathematical_statistics)

<!--Study of the practical use of statistical methods to collect, analyse, interpret, and present data in real-world contexts.-->

This repository contains my official submission for the **Applied Statistics** assessment.  
It is structured, documented, and reproducible â€” providing a clear demonstration of statistical understanding and computational implementation.

All finalised solutions and explanations are contained within the main notebook:  
**[`problems.ipynb`](./problems.ipynb)**  

No rough work or exploratory notebooks are included here; all drafts are kept locally.

## Overview & Purpose

The [**Applied Statistics**](https://atu.ie) module enables students to demonstrate their ability to:

1. **Describe** the stochastic nature of real-world measurements.  
2. **Source documentation** to programmatically perform a statistical test.  
3. **Select** the appropriate statistical test to investigate a claim.  
4. **Perform** a statistical test on a dataset and interpret the results.

This repository serves as a single, self-contained record of work aligned with these learning outcomes.
