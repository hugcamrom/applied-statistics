    "### Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal.** Under the null hypothesis (no skill), estimate the probability a participant correctly identifies *all* cups by chance in:\n",
    "- the classic **8-cup** design (4 tea-first, 4 milk-first), and\n",
    "- the **12-cup** extension (8 tea-first, 4 milk-first).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach.**\n",
    "1) The participant must choose exactly the `n_milk` “milk-first” indices; the rest are tea-first.  \n",
    "2) Under random guessing with the correct class sizes, “all correct” happens only if their chosen subset equals the true subset.  \n",
    "3) The exact probability is therefore:  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\Pr(\\text{all correct}) = \\frac{1}{\\binom{n_\\text{total}}{n_\\text{milk}}}.\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "4) We also verify by simulation.  \n",
    "5) Briefly discuss how the extended design affects evidence thresholds (p-values) and options for rejection regions."
